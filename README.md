# Sets'n'Plates

Lightweight web-based tool for powerlifters to generate warmup and work sets, along with the hardest part of weightlifting - figuring out what plates to use.

Check it out at [sets-n-plates.com](https://www.sets-n-plates.com)

Built partially because I wanted it, and partially for a chance to check out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Contributions always welcome! Please create an issue before opening a PR so we can discuss.
